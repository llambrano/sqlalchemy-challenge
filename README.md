**Station Analysis**

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Design a query to find the most active stations.


    * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.

    * Which station has the highest number of observations?

    * Hint: You will need to use a function such as func.min, func.max, func.avg, and func.count in your queries.

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).
